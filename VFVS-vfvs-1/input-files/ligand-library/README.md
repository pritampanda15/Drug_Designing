# Introduction

* This folder is intended for the input ligand library.
* The meta-tranches (directories) are directly stored within this directory.
* The input ligand library can also be stored at another location if specified in the control file. This is useful in particular if the same library is used repeatedly again by different workflows of VFVS.
